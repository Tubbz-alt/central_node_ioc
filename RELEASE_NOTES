central_node_ioc-R1-2-4:
 * Add PVs to control and readback the status of the timing core.
 * Rename IOC directory to sioc-sys2-mp01.
 * Update Central Node FPGA IP address to 10.0.0.102.
 * Give executable permission to st.cmd.
 * Update PHYSICS_TOP path used in PROD.
 * Use dictionary file which is shipped with the IOC application.

central_node_ioc-R1-2-3:
 * Fixes to the bypass string PVs, each analog threshold
   has a separate bypass string - which is indicated by
   the INP address calculated by the scripts that export
   information from the MPS database. When number of seconds
   reaches zero the string is set back to 'Not Bypassed'
 
central_node_ioc-R1-2-2:
 * build against central_node_engine-R1-2-2
 * Addition (again) of code to retrieve status of ignore
   condition for analog integrator (used for TORO DIFF 
   for EIC)

central_node_ioc-R1-2-1:
 * built against central_node_engine-R1-2-1

central_node_ioc-R1-2-0:
 * built against central_node_engine-R1-2-0
 * not compatible with R1-1-x

central_node_ioc-R1-1-0:
 * built against central_node_engine-R1-1-0

central_node_ioc-R1-0-0: first version for EIC
